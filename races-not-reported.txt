* even though the tool tracks database read-writes we do
  not report it i.e DB races are filtered from reported races.
  this is because, SQLite databases are inherently protected by 
  locks in some modes.
* even though the tool can track array accesses we have commented
  code related to this. It can be uncommented in /dalvik/vm/mterp/c/opcommon.cpp
  by searching AGET and APUT and uncommenting codeblock demarcated by
  /*Android bug-checker*/. After doing this run ./rebuild.sh in /dalvik/vm/mterp/c folder.
  run make again.
  -> we only observed array accesses for dynamically generated arrays for switch case
  startements and hence stopped tracking it for these apps.
