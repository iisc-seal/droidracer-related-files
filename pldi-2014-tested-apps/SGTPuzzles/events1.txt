before starting the exploration we had opened SGTPuzzles once and opened game 1 and then
stopped SGTPuzzles. Then DroidRacer was run. Before running, in abc.sh 12,13,14,15 and
uncomment line 11. This prevents clearing all data under
/data/data/<app-package> and thus does not start testing from
scratch across runs. 

-->1st game's screen opens
event 1: Click SGT-Back on top left corner
event 2: Click on the i-icon (2nd right optionItem)
event 3: Click on SDCard opener icon (top rightmost optionItem)

**DroidRacer reproduces this in the 2nd run
