This document explains one of the covering races in SGTPuzzles application. The others are only briefly listed
with info on the methods inside which the covering acceses happen. These methods and exact accesses can be
tracked by looking into app code and by using the TP-FP-analysis file attached.


(1) covering race: race on field SGTPuzzles.menu due to accesses inside (1) SGTPuzzles.onCreateOptionsMenu()
executed by the main thread, and (2) SGTPuzzles.changedState(). The first access initializes menu field
whereas second access checks if menu == NULL. Both these accesses can be found in SGTPuzzles.java.

races covered:
(a) race on field MenuItemImpl.mIconResId : accessed inside setEnabled method called from
SGTPuzzles.onPrepareOptionsMenu() and setEnabled() called from runOnUiThread() posted by 
SGTPuzzles.changedState(). Both these accesses are from different tasks of main thread and 
can be found in MenuItemImpl.setEnabled(). Both are write operations. 

But this race does not happen in opposite order as the null check on SGTPuzzles.menu field due to
above covering race prevents the posting of the runOnUiThread() thus the second access cant happen.

(b) race on field MenuItemImpl.mIconDrawable : same reason as above.

(c) race on field MenuItemImpl.mFlags : accessed inside setChecked method called from 
SGTPuzzles.onPrepareOptionsMenu(). The second access is from setCheckedInt() which is eventually 
called from SGTPuzzles.handleMessage() method's DONE case. A null check on menu field is present here
too preveinting the other ordering.
The code for both stChecked() and setCheckedInt() is present in MenuItemImpl.java.

(2) covering race field: name/boyle/chris/sgtpuzzles/SmallKeyboard;  field:716 field-name: SmallKeyboard.undoEnabled
    rwId:1107 - tid:1 reads undoEnabled inside SmallKeyboard.onMeasure() in msg:7
    rwId:1438 - tid:8 sets a value to undoEnabled in SmallKeyboard.setUndoRedoEnabled()

    covered races:
    (a) covered race field: com/android/internal/view/menu/MenuItemImpl;  field:24 field-name: MenuItemImpl.mTitle
        rwId:2227   and rwId:9660   covered by covering race (2)

    (b) covered race field: name/boyle/chris/sgtpuzzles/SGTPuzzles;  field:276 field-name: SGTPuzzles.hackForSubMenus
        rwId:1768  and  rwId:9395  covered by covering race (2) which does a null check before executing code that makes 
        the second rwId access 9395

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(3) covering race field: name/boyle/chris/sgtpuzzles/SGTPuzzles;  field:340  field: SGTPuzzles.undoEnabled 
    rwId:1430 - tid:8 sets redoEnabled to false inside SGTPuzzles.changedState() reached from 
    SGTPuzzles.run() containing init() as the first statement. This is spawned from SGTPuzzles.startGame()
    called from SGTPuzzles.onNewIntent() at the end of SGTPuzzles.onCreate().

    rwId:1940 - read by tid:1 inside onPrepareOptionsMenu() of SGTPuzzles in tid:10...

    covered races:
    (a) covered race field: name/boyle/chris/sgtpuzzles/SGTPuzzles;  field:344 field-name: SGTPuzzles.resizeOnDone 
        rwId:1353   and  rwId:2603  covered by covering race (3)
