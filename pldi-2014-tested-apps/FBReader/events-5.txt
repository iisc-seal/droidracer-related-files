Before running FBReader, open FBReader -> Click No-Tip option on dialog box displayed

**to reproduce this using DroidRacer start this app with DroidRacer after initializing
it by clicking on No-Tip option. Allow DroidRacer to do 5 runs on this app. The result 
reported is for the 5th run. In abc.sh 12,13,14,15 and uncomment line 11. 
This prevents clearing all data under /data/data/<app-package> and thus does not 
start testing from scratch across runs. 

this is what happens in 5th run if you wanyt to manually reproduce:
Clcik Menu -> Click Night option and exit FBReader
Reopen FBReader.

event 1: Click Menu
event 2: Click Day
event 3: Click top right corner options menu button
