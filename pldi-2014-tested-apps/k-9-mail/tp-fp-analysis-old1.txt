Async races (on single thread)

Races due to a delayed post in ancestor asyncblocks

Races due to cross thread post in ancestor asyncblocks

Races due to co-enabled events

1. class: Lcom/fsck/k9/service/MailService;  field:8197 co-enabled trigger opIds:1159, 319
    FALSE-POSITIVE: 1159 is a RESUME_ACTIVITY and 319 is a SERVICE_ARGS. startService corresponding to
    319 is issued before startActivity corresponding to 1159. Even though scheduleLaunch, scheduleServiceArgs etc.
    are one_way (i.e not synchronous from system_server side), the app process seems to queue certain kind of IPC
