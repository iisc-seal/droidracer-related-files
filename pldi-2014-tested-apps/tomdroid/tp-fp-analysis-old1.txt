Multithreaded races
-------------------
1. database path: /data/data/org.tomdroid/databases/tomdroid-notes.db  
   FALSE-POSITIVE : tid: 11 is writing to database from Runnable SdcardSyncService$Worker
   and tid:1 reads from database inside handleMessage of ViewNote$1 .. also their 
   rwIds are close by (7420 (tid:1), 7360 (tid:11)) and reordering more probable..
   Event sequence for reproduction: 
   (1)Click OK on the first dialog that appears 
   (2)Click on a Note
   (3)Click on sync button

   methods of interest: set breakpoint at Worker$run inside SdCardSyncService class
   (will be accessed by tid:11) and ViewNote's handleMessge() at showNote (will be
   accessed by tid:1).

   *Was able to reproduce database access in the other order but looks like the row read
    and rows inserted may be different. The note to be viewed in read and the sync button
    click adds new notes read from Download folder..

Races due to cross thread post in ancestor asyncblocks
------------------------------------------------------
1. class: Lorg/tomdroid/ui/Actionbar;  field:248  field-name:mPrivateFlags
   TRUE POSITIVE : both accesses are posted by two different threads and is similar to
   a reproduced pattern. (accesses: 7286, 7809)
   **Reproduced by clicking Sync button before clicking on a note.
